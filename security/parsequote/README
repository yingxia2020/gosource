Usage:
./main binary quote.dat (optional: convert)
./main base64 quote.txt

Note:
1. If add convert at the end of the command line, it will convert input file to another format,
from binary to base64 or from base64 to binary.

2. It is for SGX quote parsing only. TDX quote could be added if needed.
